```

This is a short tutorial to Genome Spy, a JavaScipt library and R package for visualizing genomic coordinates. It is most conveniently used with RStudio and/or Shiny, but it also works with vanilla R.

## Installation

The package is available in GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tuner/genome-spy")
```

## Our first visualization

Let's first import the library. We also use magrittr to conveniently add features to Genome Spy by using the pipe **%>%** operator.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(GenomeSpy)
library(magrittr)
```

Here is an example with the minimum amount of data and no extra options of any kind. The data contains a single genomic region, which we visualize using the default *simple* visualization. Genome Spy comes bundled with chromosome data (cytobands) for a few common genome assemblies. Here we use *hg38*.

By default, Genome Spy expects to find chromosome, start coordinate, and end coordinate from _chrom_, _start_, and _end_ columns, respectively.

```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  chrom = c("chr5"),
  start = c(50000000),
  end = c(150000000)
)

GenomeSpy("hg38") %>%
  segmentTrack(data)
```

Genome Spy functions are thoroughly documented. To get help, just type, for example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?segmentTrack
```

## A more advanced example

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data <- read.table("example_data.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

Our data now contais two new columns: _patient_ and _type_.

```{r echo = FALSE}
data
```

Genome Spy can display several tracks concurrently, and each track may have a different dataset and visualization type. We will stick with just one track for now.

As we would like to compare the patients with one another, we use the _patient_ column as a discriminator. Each patient then gets an own subtrack. _Type_ is just an arbitrary column that we want to use for coloring the bars produced by the _simple_ visualization.

```{r}
GenomeSpy("hg38") %>%
  segmentTrack(
    data,
    discriminator = "patient",
    vis = simpleVis(
      color = "type"
    )
  )
```

## A complete example

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data <- read.table("example_cnv.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

We finally move on to a real use case. Our data now contains genomic ranges with copy number variation data. We have two variables: Seg (segment mean) and BAF (B Allele Frequency) values. Here's a sample of the dataset:

```{r echo = FALSE}
data[1:8, ]
```

The columns that define the genomic coordinates are now named differently. Fortunately, you do not need to rename the columns - just define them explicitly by attributes _chrom_, _start_, and _end_.

Because we would like to compare the diagnosis (D) and relapse (R) samples side by side, we explicitly enumerate the cases in a specific order. By default, they are ordered alphanumerically.

Genome Spy provides you with a particular visualization (_cnvVis_) for CNV and BAF data. CNV, which is expressed as *segment mean*, is displayed as a color, ranging from blue (negative, deletion) to red (positive, amplification) through white (zero, no change). BAF is actually displayed as LOH (Loss of Heterozygosity), which is calculated using the formula: |*baf* - 0.5| * 2. The height of the bar is determined by LOH, 0% means full heterozygosity, 100% mean total loss of the B allele.

We also define a title for the data track. Looks prettier that way.

As a final touch we include a gene annotation track, which gives our data some context. The genes and transcripts become visible when you zoom in enough.

```{r}
GenomeSpy("hg19") %>%
  segmentTrack(
    data,
    
    # Define the columns for genomic coordinates
    chrom = "Chr",
    start = "Start",
    end = "End",
    
    discriminator = "case",
    
    samples = c("D1", "R1",
                "D2", "R2"),
    
    vis = cnvVis(
      # Define the columns. Defining both of them is not mandatory.
      seg = "segMean",
      baf = "bafMean"
    ),
    
    title = "CNV & LOH"
  ) %>%
  refseqGeneTrack()
```

## Using in Shiny

Here is an example of a trivial Shiny app.


```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(GenomeSpy)
library(magrittr)

ui <- basicPage(
  GenomeSpyOutput("mySpy"),
  verbatimTextOutput("info")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$mySpy <- renderGenomeSpy({
    GenomeSpy("hg38") %>%
      segmentTrack(data.frame(chrom = c("chr5"), start = c(50000000), end = c(150000000)))
  })
  
  output$info <- renderText({
    # Display the brushed range
    if (!is.null(input$mySpy_brushed)) {
      with(input$mySpy_brushed,
           sprintf("Brushed range: %s:%d - %s:%d", start$chrom, start$pos, end$chrom, end$pos))
    }
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Genome Spy communicates brushing (range selection) events back to Shiny and exposes
the selection in the input variable `outputId_brushed` where outputId is the id that has
been given to the component. In the example above it is `mySpy`. The data structure
is a two-level list or NULL if the selection was discarded:

```{r eval=FALSE}
list(
  start = list(chrom = "chr4", pos = 123456),
  end = list(chrom = "chr7", pos = 654321)
)
```
